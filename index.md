# Student Experience Survey (SES) Sentiment Analyser
This site is being developed to apply AI technologies and sentiment analysis to surface student sentiment about the best parts of their course, and the areas that require improvement. It will use a mix of (Local) fine-tuned LLMs and RAG based approaches (and cross evaulations of approaches) to determine effective ways of linking feedback analyses with tools and training to support teaching excellence.

## Key Features of the SES:

- **Target Population:** Undergraduate and postgraduate coursework students in Australian higher education institutions.
- **Responses:** Over 165,000 undergraduate and 88,000 postgraduate coursework students participated.
- **Survey Cycle:** Conducted annually in August and September.

## 2023 SES Results Summary:

The 2023 results indicate a continued improvement in the overall student educational experience; however, satisfaction levels remain below pre-pandemic figures for undergraduate students. Postgraduate coursework students showed a slight increase in satisfaction compared to pre-2020 levels, primarily driven by higher ratings from international students.

Focus areas such as Skills Development, Teaching Quality, Peer Engagement, and Learning Resources have largely returned to pre-pandemic levels, while Student Support and Services have seen a decline. These trends suggest that institutions are adapting their teaching and learning environments in the post-pandemic era.
