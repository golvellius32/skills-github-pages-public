# Student Experience Survey (SES)

The [Student Experience Survey (SES)](https://www.qilt.edu.au/surveys/student-experience-survey-(ses)) is a comprehensive annual survey targeting undergraduate and postgraduate coursework students enrolled in Australian higher education institutions. It focuses on measurable aspects of the student experience that are linked to learning and development outcomes and can potentially be influenced by higher education institutions. The insights gathered assist both institutions and the government in enhancing teaching and learning outcomes.

## Key Features of the SES:

- **Target Population:** Undergraduate and postgraduate coursework students in Australian higher education institutions.
- **Responses:** Over 165,000 undergraduate and 88,000 postgraduate coursework students participated.
- **Survey Cycle:** Conducted annually in August and September.

## 2023 SES Results Summary:

The 2023 results indicate a continued improvement in the overall student educational experience; however, satisfaction levels remain below pre-pandemic figures for undergraduate students. Postgraduate coursework students showed a slight increase in satisfaction compared to pre-2020 levels, primarily driven by higher ratings from international students.

Focus areas such as Skills Development, Teaching Quality, Peer Engagement, and Learning Resources have largely returned to pre-pandemic levels, while Student Support and Services have seen a decline. These trends suggest that institutions are adapting their teaching and learning environments in the post-pandemic era.
